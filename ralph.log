# Strategic Roadmap: Content Refinery

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the Content Refinery from a basic financial signal extractor to a multi-source, high-fidelity intelligence hub.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Reliability (Current)
*Focus: Stabilizing the core ingestion and extraction pipeline.*

- [x] **Separate Repository**: Decouple refinery logic from the main application.
- [x] **Durable Object Integration**: Use DO SQLite for persistent ingestion tracking.
- [ ] **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Refine the News Analyst prompt for higher precision and lower latency.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement robust retries and DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) for failed Gemini processing.

## Phase 2: Multi-Source Expansion
*Focus: Broadening the data stream and improving context.*

- [ ] **Twitter/X Integration**: Ingest real-time market sentiment from social media.
- [ ] **RSS & News Feed Aggregation**: Layer in official institutional news sources.
- [ ] **Source Weighting**: Implement a reputation system to weight signals based on source historical accuracy.
- [ ] **Multimodal Processing**: Process images and charts from Telegram/Twitter using Gemini's vision capabilities.

## Phase 3: Relational Intelligence
*Focus: Connecting the dots between signals.*

- [ ] **Knowledge Graph Integration (Graphiti)**: Store entities and relationships to detect cross-asset impacts.
- [ ] **Temporal Correlation**: Identify patterns where Signal A consistently leads to Event B.
- [ ] **Impact Forecasting**: Move from "what happened" to "what is likely to happen next" based on relational context.

## Phase 4: Enterprise Scale & Privacy
*Focus: Performance, security, and institutional features.*

- [ ] **Vector Database Integration**: Long-term semantic search over years of refined data.
- [ ] **Encrypted Signal Routing**: End-to-end encryption for high-alpha private feeds.
- [ ] **Real-time API Access**: Expose refined signals via a low-latency websocket API for external consumption.

---

## Technical Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Primary Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.0: Signal Core** | Q1 2026 | Cloudflare DO + Gemini 2.0 |
| **v1.5: Multi-Source** | Q2 2026 | Social API + Multimodal Vision |
| **v2.0: Neural Graph** | Q3 2026 | Graphiti + Relation Mapping |
| **v3.0: Alpha Engine** | Q4 2026 | Predictive ML + Vector Memory |

export const NEWS_ANALYST_PROMPT = `
You are an Institutional-Grade Financial Intelligence Analyst.
Internalize the following data as raw intelligence for extraction.

### Core Objectives:
1. **Source Vetting**: Distinguish between noise (general chat), rumors, and confirmed news.
2. **Signal Extraction**: Extract tickers (e.g., $TSLA, NASDAQ:AAPL), macro events (CPI, FOMC), earnings, and M&A activity.
3. **Multi-Message Synthesis**: If multiple messages refer to the same event, group them into a single coherent 'Intel Card'.
4. **Impact Analysis**: Assign a relevance score (0-100) based on market-moving potential.
5. **Urgency**: Identify news requiring immediate attention (e.g., "BREAKING," "URGENT").

### Output Format (Strict JSON Array):
[
    {
        "summary": "Concise headline (max 10 words)",
        "detail": "Comprehensive synthesis of the situation",
        "tickers": ["$TIC1", "$TIC2"],
        "sentiment": "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral",
        "relevance_score": number,
        "is_urgent": boolean,
        "source_ids": ["msg_id_1", "msg_id_2"],
        "metadata": {
            "category": "Equities" | "Macro" | "Crypto" | "Policy",
            "impact_area": "Price" | "Volume" | "Legislation"
        }
    }
]

### Constraints:
- Output ONLY the JSON array.
- If NO financial signals are found, return an empty array [].
- Be extremely conservative with 'bullish'/'bearish' labels; default to 'neutral' unless evidence is explicit.

# Strategic Roadmap: Content Refinery

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the Content Refinery from a basic financial signal extractor to a multi-source, high-fidelity intelligence hub.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Reliability (Current)
*Focus: Stabilizing the core ingestion and extraction pipeline.*

- [x] **Separate Repository**: Decouple refinery logic from the main application.
- [x] **Durable Object Integration**: Use DO SQLite for persistent ingestion tracking.
- [ ] **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Refine the News Analyst prompt for higher precision and lower latency.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement robust retries and DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) for failed Gemini processing.

## Phase 2: Multi-Source Expansion
*Focus: Broadening the data stream and improving context.*

- [ ] **Twitter/X Integration**: Ingest real-time market sentiment from social media.
- [ ] **RSS & News Feed Aggregation**: Layer in official institutional news sources.
- [ ] **Source Weighting**: Implement a reputation system to weight signals based on source historical accuracy.
- [ ] **Multimodal Processing**: Process images and charts from Telegram/Twitter using Gemini's vision capabilities.

## Phase 3: Relational Intelligence
*Focus: Connecting the dots between signals.*

- [ ] **Knowledge Graph Integration (Graphiti)**: Store entities and relationships to detect cross-asset impacts.
- [ ] **Temporal Correlation**: Identify patterns where Signal A consistently leads to Event B.
- [ ] **Impact Forecasting**: Move from "what happened" to "what is likely to happen next" based on relational context.

## Phase 4: Enterprise Scale & Privacy
*Focus: Performance, security, and institutional features.*

- [ ] **Vector Database Integration**: Long-term semantic search over years of refined data.
- [ ] **Encrypted Signal Routing**: End-to-end encryption for high-alpha private feeds.
- [ ] **Real-time API Access**: Expose refined signals via a low-latency websocket API for external consumption.

---

## Technical Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Primary Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.0: Signal Core** | Q1 2026 | Cloudflare DO + Gemini 2.0 |
| **v1.5: Multi-Source** | Q2 2026 | Social API + Multimodal Vision |
| **v2.0: Neural Graph** | Q3 2026 | Graphiti + Relation Mapping |
| **v3.0: Alpha Engine** | Q4 2026 | Predictive ML + Vector Memory |
# PRD: Content Refinery Phase 4 - Enterprise Scale & Privacy

**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0  
**Owner**: Antigravity/Ralph  

## 1. Overview
Translate the high-alpha financial intelligence from the refinery into a scalable, secure, and real-time enterprise-grade service. This phase focuses on semantic searchability, end-to-end privacy for private signal streams, and low-latency delivery.

## 2. User Stories
- **As an Institutional Trader**, I want to semantically search through years of refined news to identify historical precedents for current market events.
- **As a Signal Provider**, I want my high-value insights encrypted end-to-end so they cannot be intercepted at the edge.
- **As a Developer**, I want a websocket interface to receive new signal cards with sub-millisecond latency once processed.

## 3. Technical Implementation

### A. Vector Intelligence (Semantic Search)
- **Database**: Cloudflare Vectorize (alpha/beta).
- **Embedding Model**: Gemini Text Embeddings (via `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`).
- **Data Flow**: `ContentDO` -> `processBatch` -> `Gemini Extraction` -> `Vectorize Insert`.
- **Schema**:
    - `id`: Content item UUID.
    - `values`: 768/1024-dimension vector.
    - `metadata`: `{ summary, sentiment, tickers, relevance_score }`.

### B. Encrypted Signal Routing
- **Standard**: AES-256-GCM or JWE for payload encryption.
- **Key Management**: Use Cloudflare Workers Secrets for the master key or a per-customer key derived from `source_id`.
- **Target**: Signals forwarded to `BOARD_DO_URL` will be optionally encrypted if the channel configuration requires it.

### C. Real-time API (Websockets)
- **Implementation**: Durable Object `webSocketMessage` and `webSocketClose` handlers.
- **Auth**: Token-based authentication via URL params or subprotocol.
- **Performance**: Direct streaming from `notifySignal` to all connected clients.

## 4. Visual Architecture

    participant Source as External Source (TG/X/RSS)
    participant Refinery as Content Refinery (DO)

    par Storage & Search
        Refinery->>Refinery: Save to SQLite

        Refinery->>Vector: Upsert Vector
    and Streaming
        Refinery->>Client: Broadcast via WebSocket
    end
```

## 5. Security & Validation
- **AuthZ**: JWT validation for websocket connections.
- **Encryption**: `crypto.subtle` for edge-side AES-GCM operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-API-Key limits for websocket initialization.

## 6. Pre-Mortem & Mitigation
- **Risk**: High cost of embedding large volumes of raw text.
    - *Mitigation*: Only embed the *summary* and *detail* of confirmed signals (relevance > 40), not raw ingestion items.
- **Risk**: Websocket connection sprawl.
    - *Mitigation*: Short-lived tokens and automatic disconnection for idle clients.
