# Roadmap: Content Refinery

**Current Reality**: V3.0 - The Alpha Pipe  
**Focus**: Decomplecting and Scaling

## 🚀 Past: Complexity & Exploration (Phases 1-25)
*These phases explored Graphs, Predictive Engines, and Multi-source Ingestion (RSS/Webhooks). While valuable, they introduced "Accidental Complexity" and high storage operation costs.*

- [x] **Phase 1-17**: Knowledge Graphs & Multi-source Ingestion (Legacy).
- [x] **Phase 18-22**: Predictive Alpha & Entity Centrality (Legacy).
- [x] **Phase 24-25**: Performance Storm Analysis & Remediation.

## ⚡ Current: Phase 26: The Alpha Pipe (Active)
*Objective: Distill the system to its core essence.*

1. [x] **Logic Extraction**: Distilled business logic into the `AlphaPipe` conduit.
2. [x] **Deduplication Engine**: Hash-based analysis reuse.
3. [x] **System Cleanup**: Removal of Orchestrator, Predictive Engines, and background tickers.
4. [x] **Storage Optimization**: In-memory status counters to protect SQLite from "Operation Storms".
5. [x] **Stateless I/O**: Direct Bot API implementation.

## 🔮 Future
*The Alpha Pipe is now in maintenance mode, focusing on operational stability.*
